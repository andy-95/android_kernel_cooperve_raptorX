How to build ThunderKernel for cooperve!
========================================

By Lopicl.00@XDA-Developers

1. Download an arm-eabi toolchain.

2. Once downloaded toolchain extract it on your home folder. Enter the extracted folder and search for bin directory. That directory will be the CROSS_COMPILE bin folder (there should be arm-eabi binaries).

3. Download my kernel source from my github https://github.com/Lopicl/android_samsung_thunderkernel_cooperve.

4. Extract it in "~/android/kernel/ThunderKernel".

5. Open terminal and type "cd ~/android/kernel/ThunderKernel".

6. Now type "export ARCH=arm" and then "export CROSS_COMPILE=~/"toolchain-directory"/bin/arm-none-eabi-" substitute "toolchain-directory" with your toolchain directory.

7. Now type "make thunderkernel_cooperve_defconfig" and then "make -j(number of cpu threads to use)" for example "make -j4" for a quad-core cpu, or "make -j2" for a dual-core cpu.

8. Now the kernel is built! Use the zImage in common/arch/arm/boot and the ramdisk on my github (https://github.com/Lopicl/thunderkernel_ramdisks) for pack a boot.img.

NOTE: For pack the boot.img you can use my linux kernel kitchen --> https://github.com/Lopicl/linux_kernelkitchen
